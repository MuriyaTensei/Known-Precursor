# Known-Precursor

This mod adds an edict available that will open a selection screen where you can pick your precursor.
This edict will disappear when you select/discover a precursor.

Baol and Zroni will only be available for selection if you or the host owns Ancient Relics DLC.
Baol and Zroni dig-sites will spawn nearby your starting system.

To manually open the precursor selection menu write event `precursor_selection.0` in console.

## Mutiplayer
Should work fine with some limitations.
* The Baol and Zroni event chain can only be started once by one player.
* The ability to select all precursors is disabled. 
* Normal vanilla behavior will remain so if two or more players select the same precursor only the one that completes the chain first will spawn in the precursor system.

## Compatibility
Stellaris 3.1.* (Lem)
Not Ironman/Achivement compatible.
No vanilla files were harmed.
Should be compatible with any mods that do not change how the Baol or Zroni chains starts.

## Localization
If you want to help with translation create a fork and edit the respective language file.
