This mod adds an edict that will open a selection screen where you can pick your precursor.
This edict will disappear when you select/discover a precursor.

Baol and Zroni will only be available for selection if you or the host owns Ancient Relics DLC.
Baol and Zroni dig-sites will spawn nearby your starting system.

To manually open the precursor selection menu write [i]event precursor_selection.0[/i] in console.

[h2]Mutiplayer[/h2]
Should work fine with some limitations.
[list]
[*] The Baol and Zroni event chain can only be started once by one player.
[*] The ability to select all precursors is disabled. 
[*] Normal vanilla behavior will remain so if two or more players select the same precursor only the one that completes the chain first will spawn in the precursor system.
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Stellaris 3.1.* (Lem)
Not Ironman/Achivement compatible.
No vanilla files were harmed.
Should be compatible with any mods that do not change how the Baol or Zroni chains starts.
